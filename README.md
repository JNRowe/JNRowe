# James Rowe (he/him)

Hi, I’m James.  I’m a Senior Developer with EADS, specialising in navigation
systems(both <abbr title="Global Navigation Satellite System">GNNS</abbr> and
land-based).

You’ll find here things that are either not important enough for, or too
incomplete to warrant, their own location.

Feel free to get in touch.
